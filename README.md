## 🚀 Key Features
### ⚔️ Sniper & Execution Engine
- ⚡ **God Mode (Pre-Signed Transactions):** Pre-calculates and signs raw transactions 5 seconds before the mint opens. Broadcasts instantly at T-0 (0ms CPU latency).

- 🕒 **Time Sniper:** Auto-sleeps and wakes up exactly when the mint starts (millisecond precision).

- 🎯 **Direct Mint Support:** Compatible with any contract function (e.g., `mint`, `publicMint`, `purchase`, `claim`) via Universal ABI.

- 🧠 **Local Nonce Caching:** Caches wallet nonces locally to eliminate RPC latency on sequential transactions.

### 🛡️ Security & Reliability
- 🕵️ **Anti-Honeypot (Contract Verifier):** Verifies if the contract source code is published on Etherscan/Basescan before allowing any transaction.

- 🔄 **RPC Rotator:** Automatically switches to backup nodes if the current node fails, timeouts, or hits rate limits.

- ⛽ **Shared Gas Oracle:** Reduces RPC calls by 95% using a shared global gas price cache for all workers.

- 🛡️ **Gas Guardian:** Pauses execution if network gas price exceeds your defined limit (Gwei).

### 💰 Asset Management
- ⛽ **Auto-Funder:** Master wallet automatically tops up worker wallets if the balance is insufficient before the war starts.

- 📦 **Auto-Consolidation:** Instantly transfers minted NFTs to your specified Cold Wallet.

- 🧹 **Dust Sweeper:** Automatically withdraws leftover ETH (gas change) back to the master wallet after execution.

- 📊 **The Accountant:** Logs every successful transaction, gas cost, and total spend to `history.csv` for PnL tracking.

### 📡 Telemetry & Reporting
- 🖥️ **Real-time TUI:** Beautiful, static dashboard monitoring worker status, balances, and system logs.

- 🔔 **Discord Notifications:** Reports successful mints and asset transfers via Webhook.

- 🕵️ **Diagnostics:** Secure endpoint using `RuntimeDiagnostics`.
